mock-service
============

Quick Web service mock up framework using Node.js for unit testing.

Keep data in text files any where on your system. The path of the folders will form the url pattern for the apis.
Copy and past the data in plain text files in which ever form. ( JSON, XML, text, jsonArray)
Just give the path of it in app-local.json.

Everything is configuration driven so as to make it flexible.
